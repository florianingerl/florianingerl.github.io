Raw vegetable food should be the only nourishment taken by man. The habit of eating
cooked food should be abandoned in this world once for all. This is the unerring demand of
nature. The consumption of cooked food is the most terrible barbarism in the history of
mankind, a barbarism that no one seems to be aware of and to which everybody falls an
unconscious victim. No matter how strange the idea may seem to some, it is the absolute truth
with which we cannot but acquiesce.

<p>Cooking food is the greatest barbarism. No one seems to be aware of this.</p>

This truth became evident to me when, after 18 years of careful study and investigation, I
became convinced that the deaths of my 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter were caused
by unnatural nutrition. The great number of medical examinations carried out in Iran, France,
Germany and Switzerland in various attempts made to discover some specific disease in their
organisms and the subsequent administration of numerous remedies had a considerable share,
too, in bringing the tragedy to a head. My children died of the gradual emaciation and wasting
away of all their organs caused by unnatural feeding and poisonous medicines.

I have been able to penetrate into the secrets of medical science and to observe its good and
bad aspects all the more clearly, because I have not been inspired by the prospect of becoming a
doctor or of making any financial gains. My incentive has been in the first place the wish to do my
best for the recovery of the health of my beloved children, and later the ardent desire to
perpetuate their memory by being useful to humanity.

<VueExercise instruction="Translate!">
Example:
<p>Ich spare Geld und Zeit, indem ich nicht zum Doktor gehe.</p>
<p>I save money and time by not going to the doctor.</p>

Another factor which has contributed to my better realization. of the shortcomings of
medical science is the entirely new system by which I have carried out my studies by selfeducation,
free from the encumbrance of an academic programme. I have never become
intoxicated by the exaggerated claims of progress made on behalf of medical science or by all the
fanciful tales of the fabulous benefits to be derived from medicines. I have approached these
questions with a critical mind and have always laid greater stress on their shortcomings.

Moreover, I have constantly kept in view the fact that, in spite of the existence of millions of qualified doctors and a large number of Nobel prize-winners,
civilized man falls victim to various illnesses more often than any other animals, and diseases like
sclerosis, diabetes, heart attacks and cancer increase at an alarming rate, threatening to wipe out
mankind from the face of the earth. I have not wasted my time in memorizing the symptoms of
diseases, the names and doses of medicines and those numerous complicated formulae that are
seldom needed, because I have never had the intention of sitting for examinations and obtaining
degrees. Instead, so far as possible, I have devoted my time to the study of a great many branches
of science and to the examination of the multifarious sources of knowledge, from the fundamental
and general principles of which I have been able to draw certain essential, vital conclusions.

The results of 18 years of painstaking study and labor have been embodied in a work of two
large volumes, the first of which, a book of 568 pages, was published in Armenian in 1960.
<h2>The Efficient Operation of Every Factory is Subject to the
Uniform Supply of All the Raw Materials
Specified by the Engineer</h2>
Until the discovery of fire, along with the rest of the animal kingdom, man had developed
and carried out his evolution by the consumption of natural, raw nourishment. But since the
discovery of fire, without much reflection, men have put natural foodstuffs on the fire, have
destroyed their essential constituents, have debased them and have then nourished their bodies
with them. As a direct consequence, there have resulted all the diseases from which all mankind
suffer today.

The human organism is the masterpiece of nature. Man is the most complicated and the
most perfect living factory constructed by the unceasing efforts of nature over a period of 1.5
billion years. Simultaneously, with the construction of this factory, our wonderful nature has
made use of the rays of the sun to develop all the raw materials which are necessary to coordinate
the thousands of complicated operations of our organism and to ensure corresponding
production. Furthermore, nature has placed those raw materials in their entire perfection and in
the faultless harmony of their various constituents in a tiny grain of the corn, in a pulpy seed of
a pomegranate, in a berry of the grape or in a leaf of a plant. Each of the "paltry" foodstuffs taken
separately contains all those factors that are necessary to keep alive the living organism of a being
like man.
