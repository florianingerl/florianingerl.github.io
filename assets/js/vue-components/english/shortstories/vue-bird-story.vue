Lara had always wanted a pet, preferably a bird because she liked them singing.
After school, she always went to the pet shop and looked at a lovely green bird sitting in a cage in the window waiting 
for his new owner.
<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['Position of adverbs']" instruction="Bring the words into the correct order!">
<VueWordOrder lg="en" :sentences="['I will never be able to fly.',
'I have not heard such a beautiful voice before.',
'I have not brushed my teeth yet.',
'I often play football with friends.'],
">

</VueWordOrder>
</VueExercise>
One day, Lara's father who had so far objected a pet, unfortunately died from poisoned food, and so there wasn't any obstacle any more to buy the lovely green bird from the shop.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with either reject, object, refuse, deny or contradict">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['Sometimes, I create tests on francaisfacile.com that are {rejected} because they lack the necessary quality.',
'If nobody {objects}, I will leave now.',
'Her invitation is so nice that I can not {refuse} it.',
'The thief {denied} that he had stolen the car.',
'Galileo Galilei {contradicted} older scientists by saying that the earth wasn\'t flat.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>
So Lara and her mother went to the shop and purchased the little bird. 
They were both very happy the next morning when they woke up and heard the little bird singing.
It was time to name him.
<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with either an infinitv or an ing-form!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['I saw the accident {happen|happening}.',
'I heard the bird {singing|sing}.',
'I heard my father {switch off|switching off} the television.',
'I feel the sun {warming|warm} my skin.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>
"I would like to learn from this bird to be able to sing as well as it can" Lara sighed.
Since Lara's mum wanted to cheer her daughter up after the death of her father, 
she agreed to her wish and found her an excellent music teacher.
Fortunately, the music teacher also liked birds and their singing and could even communicate with birds , so the three of them could work pretty effectively together.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Choose correctly between singular and plural.">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['After the violent football match, all the players had {their wounds|their wound} treated.',
'My aunt has ten cats and I like to touch {their tail|their tails}.',
'The father likes his children tell him something about {their life|their lives}.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>
"What a perfect duo the two of you make!" said the music teacher after Lara and Ken, the bird sang a duet together.
"You will see that the two of you will soon get invited to sing your songs in front of a grand audience!" he went on to predict.
<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps by an infinitiv or an ing-form">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['Fred continued {sleeping|to sleep} although it was already 8 o\'clock.',
'Fred first ate an apple and then he continued {to eat|eating} a banana.',
'Fred continued {lamenting|to lament} about the difficulty of his homework instead of just doing it.',
'Fred did his Math homework and then he continued {to do|doing} his French homework.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

Since they had just begun the lessons, Lara had some doubts about this prediction, one afternoon 
they received an unexpected letter from the Royal Family of the country who invited them to the palace to sing 
for the King.
<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with either who or which!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['Did you see the man {who} stole the car?',
'The letter from Dave {which} I received only yesterday lies still unread on my desk.',
'Lionel Messi, {who} ended his football career in the USA, has several children and a wife.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

On the big day, when Lara and her bird arrived at the palace, all the beautiful and rich people were dancing 
and laughing already and they encoutered there thus an already nice atmosphere.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Choose between the past progressive or the simple past!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['Dave {was dreaming} (dream) when suddenly his teacher {asked} (ask) him a question.',
'Brigitte {was tidying up} (tidy up) her room when the phone {rang} (ring).',
'Kevin {was listening} (listen) to an audio book when his mother {asked} (ask) him to help her in the kitchen.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>
This was Lara's first time to perform in front of such important people so she felt a little bit nervous.
But the presence and the support of her pet gave her some comfort and soon, she felt ready to get on the stage.
<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Choose the right feeling!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :same="true" :gaptext="['Sally is always {frightened|} in the darkness.',
'I am {angry|} because I paid someone 30 euro for an electronic dictionary and he didn\'t send it to me afterwards.',
'I am very {tired|} because of lack of sleep.',
'Since my father died last week, I am very {sad|}.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

"Don't stop singing!" the whole royal family and their relatives exclaimed after Lara and her bird had already sung
for 1 hour and wanted to take a break.
Not wanting to offend the royals, Lara and her bird kept singing for another hour. At the end of their performance, 
they were applauded for many minutes. This is how their music career started.
<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Make one sentence out of the two as in the example!">
<p>
Example: He didn't want to offend his father. Kevin kept the silence. -> Not wanting to offend his father, Kevin kept the silence.

<ol>
<li>Brigitte didn't know the correct answer to the question. She invented something.</li>
<li>The mother didn't care for her child. The mother let it starve.</li>
<li>Dave doesn't like Math. He usually reads fantasy books during Math lessons.</li>
</ol>

It was a huge honour for them and not only Lara, but even her bird got all red in the face because they were so flattered.
Of course, there were journalists present at the event as well so the next day the whole country could read about
their magnificent performance.
<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with either even or only!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['{Even} I can heal people by laying my hands onto their body, so everyone can do Reiki.',
'{Only} Harry knows all the secret corridors in Hogwarts.',
'{Even} the most boring book comes from some author who had the energy to write it.',
'I love {only} you and I want to marry you.']">
</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

"Which teacher did you use to have now such magnifienct singing capabilities?" the journalist had asked them whereupon
 Lara had responded that the talent of the bird was natural and that hers was due to hard work with the bird's patient 
 training.

 <VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with mine, yours, hers, his, ours or theirs">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['You haven\'t got a pencil? Well, I can\'t give you {mine} because I need it myself.',
'Me and you have written a story. My story is entertaining whereas {yours} is dead boring.',
'Gustav and his wife buy their clothes at different shops. His clothes are cheap whereas {hers} are very expensive.']">

</VueMCGaps>
 </VueExercise>
The interview went very well. However, unfortunately when Lara read the article the next day, 
she discovered that it was full of brazen (=shameless) lies which were a big risk to their reputation 
so they quickly needed to find a solution to fix this situation.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with the opposite!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['Lara is a {beautiful} (ugly) woman.',
'There is only a {small} (big) risk that the sky falls on our head.',
'The glass is {empty} (full).']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>
In order to not get distracted in the future by such stupid articles, Lara simply stopped reading the newspapers. 
Ken hadn't had any problem, because he had never been able to read.
Thankfully, the public didn't believe the article so Lara and Ken remained loved by the Royal family
and enjoyed their support in their blossoming career for many years.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Make one sentence out of the two as in the example!">
<p>
Example: Kevin didn't want to bother his father. He did his homework all alone. -> In order to not bother his father, Kevin did his homework all alone.

<ol>
<li>Sally didn't want to become fat. She didn't eat the cake.</li>
<li>Florian doesn't want to become a dull person. So he pays for language classes twice a week.</li>
<li>Florian doesn't want to waste money. So he doesn't buy the vegetables from the supermarket which aren't fresh.</li>
