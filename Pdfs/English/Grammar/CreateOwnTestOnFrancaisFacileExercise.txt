Maybe we can create today a short grammar test together.
We could do it on the simple topic "Difference between should and had better".

We could work in the Miro Whiteboard like this:

1) One gives instructions to the other one (e.g make a sentence with should or had better which has something to do with football and a goalkeeper who is often drunk )

2) The other one makes then the sentence

3) We change the roles

In the end, we should have 10 sentences in no time. We can put that test on anglaisfacile.com
